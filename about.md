I enjoy exploring the infinite possibilities of life. Whether it is academic or professional development, I have the courage to keep trial and error and iterate my choices. When I'm not working, I like to watch suspenseful movies, play video games, eat hot pot and travel. I used to study piano for five years when I was a child, which made it easy for me to stay focused, but also led to a less-than-easy childhood.
